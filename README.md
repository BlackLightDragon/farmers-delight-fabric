### Overview

Farmer's Delight is a mod that gently expands upon farming and cooking in Minecraft.

Using a collection of rustic tools and workstations, you can improve upon the foundation of your farm plots, prepare an assortment of healthy meals and snacks for you and your pets, and even equip yourself a bit better for adventuring across the land.

This mod focuses on giving more purpose to items often forgotten or overlooked by players (such as milk, mushrooms, beetroots etc). Hopefully this will encourage you to farm a little bit of everything!

### Fabric port+

This mayhaps once be the updated verion of the port from Zifiv, with the goal to get it up to 1.21.
I'm super slow, so don't expect anything if you happen to find this
